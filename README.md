# PowerFit India -- Fitness Club Excel Analysis

## üìå Project Overview

This project is an **advanced Excel-based analysis** for *PowerFit
India*, a fitness club chain. The goal is to help the management team
better understand their membership base by analyzing:

-   **Retention trends** (how long members stay active)\
-   **Revenue patterns** (by membership type & city)\
-   **Referral performance** (impact of referrals on revenue)\
-   **Attendance behavior** (engagement insights)\
-   **Demographics** (gender & age distributions)

All analysis was conducted in **Excel** using formulas, pivot tables,
conditional formatting, and interactive dashboards.

A supporting Excel file contains the complete analysis and
visualizations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis Performed

### 1. Membership Duration

-   Added column **Membership_Duration_Months**\

        =DATEDIF(Start_Date, End_Date, "M")

-   Assumption: 1 month = 30 days

### 2. Referral Impact

    non-referred members

### 3. Revenue Calculation

        =Monthly_Fee √ó Membership_Duration_Months

-   Summarized revenue by:

    -   Premium members\
    -   Family membership\
    -   City-wise distribution

### 4. Low Engagement Members

-   Conditional Formatting rule: highlight members with
    -   Attendance `< 10`\
    -   AND Membership_Duration_Months `>= 12`\
-   Flags long-term but inactive users

### 5. Segment Profitability Dashboard
